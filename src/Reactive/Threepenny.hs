{- $intro

At its core, Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is about two
data types 'Event' and 'Behavior' and the various ways to combine them.

-}

{-| @Event a@ represents a stream of events as they occur in time.
Semantically, you can think of @Event a@ as an infinite list of values
that are tagged with their corresponding time of occurence,

> type Event a = [(Time,a)]
-}
newtype Event    a = E { unE :: Memo (Pulse a) }

{-| @Behavior a@ represents a value that varies in time. Think of it as

> type Behavior a = Time -> a
-}
data    Behavior a = B { latch :: Latch a, changes :: Event () }

newEvent = do
    (p, fire) <- Prim.newPulse
    return (E $ fromPure p, fire)

-- exactly once when the event is first "brought to life",
-- e.g. when an event handler is registered to it.

> instance Applicative Behavior

'Behavior' is an applicative functor. In particular, we have the following functions.

> pure :: a -> Behavior a

The constant time-varying value. Think of it as @pure x = \\time -> x@.

> (<*>) :: Behavior (a -> b) -> Behavior a -> Behavior b

Combine behaviors in applicative style.
Think of it as @bf \<*\> bx = \\time -> bf time $ bx time@.

-}

{- $recursion

Recursion in the 'IO' monad is possible, but somewhat limited.
The main rule is that the sequence of IO actions must be known
in advance, only the values may be recursive.

Good:

> mdo
>     let e2 = apply (const <$> b) e1   -- applying a behavior is not an IO action
>     b <- accumB $ (+1) <$ e2

Bad:

> mdo
>     b <- accumB $ (+1) <$ e2          -- actions executed here could depend ...
>     let e2 = apply (const <$> b) e1   -- ... on this value
