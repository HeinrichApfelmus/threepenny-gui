{- | Static configuration for a "Foreign.JavaScript" server.

This is a record type which has the following fields:

* @jsPort :: Maybe Int@          

    Port number.
    @Nothing@ means that the port number is read from the environment variable @PORT@.
    Alternatively, port @8023@ is used if this variable is not set.

* @jsAddr :: Maybe ByteString@

    Bind address.
    @Nothing@ means that the bind address is read from the environment variable @ADDR@.
    Alternatively, address @127.0.0.1@ is used if this variable is not set.

* @jsCustomHTML :: Maybe FilePath@

    Custom HTML file to replace the default one.

* @jsStatic :: Maybe FilePath@

    Directory that is served under @/static@.

* @jsLog :: ByteString -> IO ()@

    Function to print a single log message.

* @jsWindowReloadOnDisconnect :: Bool@

    Reload the browser window if the connection to the server was dropped accidentally,
    for instance because the computer was put to sleep and awoken again.

* @jsCallBufferMode :: CallBufferMode@

    The initial 'CallBufferMode' to use for 'runFunction'.
    It can be changed at any time with 'setCallBufferMode'.

* @jsSSLBind :: Maybe ByteString@

    Bind address for @HTTPS@.
    @Nothing@ means that the bind address is read from the environment variable @ADDR@.
    Alternatively, address @0.0.0.0@ is used if this variable is not set.

* @jsSSLCert :: Maybe FilePath@

    Path to SSL certificate file.
    @Nothing@ means that the path to SSL certificate file is @cert.pem@.

* @jsSSLCert :: Maybe FilePath@

    Path to SSL certificate file.
    @Nothing@ means that the path to SSL certificate file is @cert.pem@.

* @jsSSLChainCert :: Maybe Bool@

    If it is SSL chain certificate file.
    @Nothing@ means that False.

* @jsSSLKey :: Maybe FilePath@

    Path to SSL key file.
    @Nothing@ means that the path to SSL key file is @key.pem@.

(For reasons of forward compatibility, the constructor is not exported.)

{- Note [ServerMsg strictness]

The type `ServerMsg` may contain components that evalute to _|_, and
an exception will be thrown when we try to send one of those to the browser.

However, we have to make sure that the exception is thrown
in the thread that constructed the message, not in the thread that
handles the actual communication with the client.

That's why we have to use the function
`Control.DeepSeq.deepseq` to make sure that any exception
is thrown before handing the message over to another thread.

Since exceptions in pure code do not have a precise ordering relative
to exceptions in IO code, evaluating the pure value
also helps with ensuring that the exception is raised before
any subsequent IO exception; this makes it easier to pinpoint
the root cause for library users.
